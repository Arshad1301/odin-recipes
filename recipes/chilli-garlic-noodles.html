        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Chilli garlic noodles are full of flavors and make for a great meal on their own or paired with Asian-style curries like Vegetables in Hot Garlic Sauce, Thai Basil Chicken, or Sweet And Sour Vegetables. The good part is that making these spicy Chili Garlic Noodles at home is super easy. They come together in under 30 minutes using simple ingredients.
